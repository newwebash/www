COVID-19 Update 03 - New Portland Conference Dates
==================================================

Hey Folks,

We hope that you're doing okay. It's been a stressful few weeks, and we wanted to send positive thoughts as we all attempt to get through this. `Please let us know`_ if there is anything we can do to help you. 

The true power of community comes in the most trying of times. It's been amazing watching folks come together on :doc:`Slack </slack>`, and we're trying to plan more ways for folks to feel connected and supported.

We also wanted to give you an update on the Portland conference. **We have a new date, August 9-11, 2020.**

Given all the uncertainty about the future, we are being cautious in our approach with the conference.
We're announcing the new date so that people can mark it on their calendars,
but we're waiting to open ticket sales again until we are certain that the event can proceed. 
We recommend that you not book new travel until we open ticket sales again.

We know that changing the conference dates means that not everyone will be able to attend.
In order to more easily handle requests for changes, we `created a form`_ to handle incoming ticket change requests. 

We'll continue to be in touch with updates about the conference and other ways to connect with all our lovely documentarians.
